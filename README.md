# OCR Receipt Processor

This Python script processes receipt images using OCR technology. It extracts date and total amount information, categorizes spending, and saves the data to an Excel file. Features include:

- Image preprocessing
- Text extraction using Tesseract OCR
- Date and total amount parsing
- Spending categorization
- User confirmation of extracted data
- Excel output

Requirements: OpenCV, Pytesseract, Pillow, pandas, openpyxl

Usage: Run `main()` function and follow prompts to input receipt image paths.

Note: This is a prototype with room for improvement in accuracy and feature set.
